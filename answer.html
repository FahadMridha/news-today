            <h2>Qsn-2.What is the difference between arrow function and regular function?</h2>
            <h4>Difference between arrow function and regular function:-</h4>
            <p>Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this . The value of this inside an
                arrow function remains the same throughout <br> the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the
                value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.</p>
            <h2>Qsn-3.why you use template string in javascript?</h2>
            <h4>Because of:-</h4>
            <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older
                versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.
